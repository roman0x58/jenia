## - about
**Jenia** is an open-source cross-platform application that provides a usable GUI interface for Jenkins CI. It should make you happy to build your code every day. This application have been created as a hobby project and the first purpose of it is to build your Jenkins CI jobs quickly and less painfully, becuase IMHO the Jenkins UI is a bit ugly and unsable. Jenia built on [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) and uses [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org).

## - installation
Just download the specific package for your platform on the [releases](https://github.com/roman0x58/jenia/releases) page or directly from the [website](https://jenia.pl). 
- Jenia was tested using Jenkins of version 1.6xx, 2.5x, 2.6x with or without Git plugin. 
- The time on Jenkins server should be correctly set, otherwise you will see an incorrect build progress status.
> N.B. If you have some troubles with a package for your OS or found some bugs please create an issue about this.

## - features
* The bookmarks with hotkeys for your jobs with access from the tray menu
* Compact & better UI than default Jenkins CI interface
* Shorthand actions for a job such as console output and build job.
* Parametrizied build support (The application only supports choiсe, string, text, boolean parameters, if you have a different parameter than you can create PR or Issue for this)

## - todo's
The application still in a developing process and have the tons of ideas and some things that need be refactored, but general I want to do the next in the future
* Additional information at the build view (such as parameters of a build)
* System notifications for finished builds
